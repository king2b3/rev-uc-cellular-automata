# Conway's Game of Life
Known to some simply as "Life", Conway's Game of Life is an implementation of cellular automata with a few basic rules. The game was proposed by [John Horton Conway in 1970](https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/Students/Conway07.pdf), and fun fact is actually [Turing complete](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~welling/teaching/271fall09/Turing-Machine-Life.pdf)! The rules are simple, there is some 2-D grid of square cells. Each cell can be either *alive* or *dead*. The cell then looks at its 8 neighbors (Manhattan) to decide what its next state will be.
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies. (Underpopulation)
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on.
3. Any live cell with four or more live neighbors dies. (Overpopulation)
4. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell. (Reproduction)

And thats it! You'd be amazed with what can be created with just these simple rules and some specific starting patterns. We won't show them all here, but here are some [examples of patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns) which exist within the game.


We first wanted to test our framework by implementing the Game of Life, so have fun and see what you can make!
